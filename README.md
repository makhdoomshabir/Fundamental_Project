### Future Version Improvements 

*A login page would be the next priority to allow multiple users to create and store their data as individual users. 
*A more aesthetic front end to entice client customers to use the application. This would be achieved with CSS.
*More accessible features such as the ability to alter fonts, font size, title sizes, add images, organise the structure of the page.
*Smaller implementations such as adding a "date created" and an "author" for each post created.
